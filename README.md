# Project Management Dashboard

## Overview
The project, managed using MS Project, focuses on two main business problems: evaluating Airbnb's superhost status criteria and conducting a tract-level analysis to optimize booking processes. Our team has implemented a comprehensive project plan that includes data collection, segmentation, feature engineering, and advanced analytics techniques such as sentiment analysis and machine learning.
